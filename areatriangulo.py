# Create a program that calculates the area of a triangle. The user must enter the base and height.

# Ask the user for the base and height of the triangle
base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))

# Calculate the area of the triangle
area = 0.5 * base * height

# Print the area of the triangle
print("The area of the triangle is:", area)
